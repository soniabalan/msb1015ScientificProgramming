## Getting Started

There are 2 main scripts in this project: 1_DataCleaning.R and 2_Visualisations.R. Both of them can be run independently, provided you also have the Data folder. If you want to replicate the steps taken in this project, first run the Data Cleaning script first and then the Data Visualisations script.

### Prerequisites

Prerequisites are avaiable in the 0_Dependencies.R file. This code was run on a Lenovo Yoga laptop on R 2022.7..1+554, some of the packages used might be deprecated.
